 * Easy (82.77%)
 * Total Accepted:    234.4K
 * Total Submissions: 282.4K
 * Testcase Example:  '"aA"\n"aAAbbbb"'
 *
 * You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and
 * S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone
 * you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also
 * jewels.
 * 
 * The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
 * letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type
 * of stone from "A".
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
 * The characters in J are distinct.
