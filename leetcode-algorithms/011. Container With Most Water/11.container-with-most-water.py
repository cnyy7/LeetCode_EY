# Testcase Example:  '[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]'
#
# Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point
# at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints
# of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with
# x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
#
# Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
#
#
#
#
#
# The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In
# this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is
# 49.
#
#
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        i, j = 0, len(height)-1
        maxwater = 0
        while i < j:
            if height[i] > height[j]:
                maxwater = max(maxwater, min(height[i], height[j])*(j-i))
                j -= 1
            else:
                maxwater = max(maxwater, min(height[i], height[j])*(j-i))
                i += 1
        return maxwater
