#
# Given an array of integers where 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some
# elements appear twice and others appear once.
#
# Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
#
# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the
# returned list does not count as extra space.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
# [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
#
# Output:
# [5,6]

class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        new = [i for i in range(1, len(nums)+1)]
        return list(set(new)-set(nums))
